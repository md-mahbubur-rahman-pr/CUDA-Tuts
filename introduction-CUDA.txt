CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. 

CUDA is an extension of C/C++ programming. 

CUDA works as an API model for parallel computing created by Nvidia, for programming and managing GPUs.

We can also say, CUDA provides a platform and programming model for CUA enabled GPUs.The platform
exposes GPUs for general purpose computing. 

In CUDA, both CPUs and GPUs are being used for computing where CPU system as host and GPU as device. 

CPUs and GPUs are separated platforms with their own respective memory space where we run serial workload on CPU 
and offload parallel computations to GPUs.
